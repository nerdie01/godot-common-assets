# godot common assets

following the advice of https://youtu.be/QPuIysZxXwM?si=oGzbk62zPPP3Hqju i have decided to create a project containing various components i can reuse for stuff, feel free to use anything from here ig there is a scene menu when you launch the game to check all the prototypes out. also an opportunity to free myself from inheritance and take the composition pill
